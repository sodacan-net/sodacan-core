# SodaCan Agent
The SodaCan agent provides a framework around the execution of one or `modules`. It also is where custom or plugin code can be added to a module for specific kinds of interfaces.

An agent contains timer and clock capabilities used by modules. And, finally, it is an agent which subscribes and responds to inbound messages from the message bus.
