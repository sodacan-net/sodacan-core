# Sodacan Command Line Interface
This utility provides for administrative and operational functions.

This program uses the Sodacan API for many functions but also communicates directly with Kafka and the operating system for other functions. It provides the deepest level of control of Sodacan short of modifying source code.

In order to provide the fullest coverage of Sodacan capabilities, an option for most commands allows for direct access to the message bus, access via the Sodacan API, and via the Sodacan REST API.

```

### Mode
When mode is specified on a command-line, it means that the action, such as deploying a module, will be separate from the actions in other modes.
This is often used for testing. For a new or updated module, for example, you may want to test it in the real system yet keep the
current configuration as is.

- make a copy of the default mode to a new mode name
- deploy one or more new modules with `-m <mode>` option
- Using the cli, you can send and receive messages to this new mode by including option `-m <mode>`

In this way, the live system is unaffected by the testing mode.

Once the testing is complete:
 
- delete the testing mode to reclaim its space
- apply the changes to the default mode

At this point, the live system if using the new or updated component.
