# Developer Guide
This guide covers Module Development. It will probably help to first get a general overview by reading the architecture document. Also, this document frequently refers to modules which are described in more detail in the language guide and language reference documents.

### Setting up a Development Environment
If you are starting from scratch then see the gettingStarted document to learn how to setup a SodaCan installation. 

If you have a SodaCan implementation already running, perhaps even a live on, then the easiest way to get started is by creating a mode. This gives you a sandbox to play in without affecting the live application.

The remainder of this guide is based on having a Linux command-line.
