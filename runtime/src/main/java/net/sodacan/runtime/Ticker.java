/**
 * <p>Our job is to provide clock ticks, one per minute without skipping or duplicating any individual ticks. We run in our own
 * thread and deliver clock ticks to the specified queue. The clock can be a real clock or a synthetic clock used for testing.
 * In any case, the supplied clock will not affect our job of producing one tick per minute.</p>
 * <p>Each module needs a separate Ticker because each module could be on a different mode/clock and very likely will be at a different point in 
 * its lifecycle (or cycle).</p>
 * <p>This class will deliver ticks only as the underlying clock allows. The tick is never allowed to overtake the clock. However,
 * ticks may occur very quickly if the tick time falls behind the clock for any reason.</p>
 * <p>This Ticker does not advance the raw clock, which must be provided by an external time source.</p>
 * <p>Note: This Ticker is not used for Sodacan Timers - which have a much smaller time resolution than
 * Ticker (nominally one minute).</p>
 * <p>A side note about the cycle function: The message stream also contains a timestamp which, along with the Tick queue is used to merge events into a module.
 * This is helpful for testing or startup when the arrival messages could get ahead of the clock thereby causing 
 * passage-of-time statements to occur out of order.</p>
