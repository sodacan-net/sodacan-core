# SodaCan Web Server
This Web Server hosts static web pages and the RESTful API (which in turn used the SodaCan API). The static pages provide the Soda Can control panel, dashboard, and administrative capabilities in a graphical format with similar capabilities to the Command Line Interface (CLI).

The RESTful API is used by the static pages and can also be used instead of the SodaCan API for message input and output to programs that might otherwise not be able to communicate over ports other than HTTP and HTTPS.
